# Pilgrims

The Pilgrimage is an important rite for everyone in the Horizon, and for some it is their calling.
Other pilgrims travel for different reasons than to visit the holy sites: looking for work, searching for wisdom, or spreading joy to the Horizon as traveling circuses.
Lastly, there are the nomads of the Horizon. They usually remain in one system or one sector, but sometimes they also travel through the dangerous portal fields.
Regardless of why you travel, your lives will be hard and painful.
Getting to visit the Dome of the Icons on Coriolis, the Leaning Prayer Tower on Algol, Mira’s Icon City, or the temple city of Lotus on Dabaran is achieved only by the truly dedicated – as is experiencing the joy of the audience as Kassar the Nimble performs his triple salto mortale.

The Pilgrims group concept can also be used for:

* “Hands” – traveling workers taking jobs where they are to be found.
* Traveling circuses made up of entertainers and performers.
* Space nomads, perpetually trudging the starry void.

Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Pilgrims:

* Preacher (missionary). You preach, see visions, and strive to make the peoples of the Horizon understand the greatness of the Icons.
* Negotiator (diplomat). You are the one who makes sure that your crew always gets to your destinations – acquiring new passports and papers with the correct stamps, as well as paying the occasional bribe.
* Ship worker (deckhand). You can work just about anywhere, be it on a ship or in a bar – someone with a broad skill set is always needed, and that someone is you.
* Artist (courtesan). As a master of the arts of pleasure, you can perform anything from a chai ceremony to intricate dances and the sacred Algolan incense prayers.
* Negotiator (peddler). You are a traveling merchant, supplying whatever people are demanding.

Patron/Nemesis ideas:

* High Priestess Taminasah-Buri (the Church of the Icons).</br>
A woman of the faith, supporting all of the Horizon’s believers seeking the truth of the Icons.
* High General Abassar Douk (the Free Uharan Army).</br>
A leader of rebel forces all across the Menkar arm, an idealist and a pragmatist in one.
* Captain Mero (commander of the bulk hauler “Mero’s Promise”).</br>
A generous soul who lets anyone travel onboard his ship as long as they help out in some way.
* Io “the Smile” Xoma (circus director).</br>
Owner of several traveling circuses in the Kua system.
* Shuja Mulk-Chitral (leader of the Mehtar nomads).</br>
Started the Hargadour rebellion to unite the nomads in the sector of the Lady of Tears.

Group talents:

* LAST LAUGH</br>
You can get yourselves out of a pinch using your knack for entertainment. The GM gets 1 DP per use. One use per session for the whole group (not once per PC).
* MERCY OF THE ICONS</br>
When you are in a tight spot, the Icons will hear you. This means that you can cancel the effects of Darkness Points that have just been spent by the GM (Chapter 3). One use per session for the whole group (not once per PC).
* ONE LAST BIRR</br>
You can make a living out of your craft or performances. Test dexterity instead of manipulation to find basic subsistence (food, drink, repairs – no new gear) when in a new place.
