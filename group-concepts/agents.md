# Agents

Birr and Legionnaires are not always the best tools for a faction – sometimes, more subtle means are required. This is where the Agent cells come in.
Typical jobs for a group of Agents might be infiltrating Dabaran courts, assassinating dignitaries, tracking down lost relatives, or just keeping the scum on Coriolis in check.

The Agents group concept can also be used for:

* Judicators keeping the Coriolis station free from criminals.
* Assassins making sure that troublemakers disappear.
* Detectives for hire.

Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Agents:

* Artist (courtesan). You are the true manipulator. Your skill and reputation gets you in anywhere, and what you need doing done.
* Data spider (correspondent). You dig through old archives, Bulletin logs and info terminals. No stored information is out of your reach.
* Operative (spy). You are the core of the cell with your skill set of infiltration, subtle cons, and surveillance.
* Soldier (officer). All groups need organization and contacts, things you possess as well as practical knowledge of combat and social interaction.
* Trailblazer (scout). If anyone can follow a trail – in a crowded bazaar or on the vast savannah – it’s you.

Patron/Nemesis ideas:

* Captain Girrah (Judicator).</br>
Completely loyal to the Governor of Coriolis, and prepared to counter any threat to the station, even if it means breaking the rules.
* Jihvane Kourides (Special Branch of the Consortium).</br>
A field agent rising through the ranks who will stop at nothing to climb even higher.
* Hiram “the Black Widow” Momasdi (Ahlam’s Black Lotuses).</br>
An aged madam who is secretly an assassin, offering her customers anything but pleasure.
* Nefrite Garroud (the Free League’s news division).</br>
Wants to know everything that could affect the League’s activities in the Horizon.

Group talents:

* A FRIEND IN EVERY PORT </br>
You can find a useful contact in a new place. The contact can protect you, lend you gear, or vouch for you with the local rulers. The GM gets 1 DP per use. One use per session for the whole group (not once per PC).
* ASSASSIN’S GUILD</br>
You can test infiltration instead of melee combat when you make a melee combat attack against an enemy who isn’t aware of you.
* DANCERS OF AHLAM</br>
You can test dexterity instead of manipulation when trying to make a good impression.
