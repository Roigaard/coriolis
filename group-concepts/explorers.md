# Explorers

The Horizon is full of mysteries to uncover.
You are truth seekers who refuse to settle for the Bulletin’s oversimplified version of reality.
It’s all there, if you just scratch the surface a little.
Explorers not only delve into the past, they also push beyond the frontiers of the Horizon – as colonists, curious anthropologists or traveling journalists.
As Explorers, you dig through the frozen ruins on Surha, the remnants of the Portal Builders in the jungles of Kua, or search for forgotten colonies along the Enau Arm.

The Explorers group concept can also be used for:

* Prospectors seeking valuable minerals in dangerous asteroid belts.
* Colonists valiantly claiming new settlements for the peoples of the Horizon.
* Correspondents reporting the news no one else dares to.

Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Explorers:

* Scientist (archaeologist). Whether it’s digging for ruins in the desert or mapping the mysterious gravitation pools, you are an explorer in the truest sense.
* Trailblazer (prospector). You know how to find all the Horizon’s riches, from ice ore or Helium-3 to shipwrecks or the finest timber.
* Scientist (technician). Whether it’s calibrating the macroscope and the deep space sensors, or repairing the colony’s old grav tractor, you are essential to the group.
* Pilot (freighter pilot). The crew would get nowhere without you, especially if the destination is somewhere no one’s been in a while.
* Trailblazer (scout). As a colonist or pathfinder, you are vital to discovering both valuables and threats during your travels.
* Data spider (correspondent). You are the number one news hunter. No truths slip by your keen eyes and ears.

Patron/Nemesis ideas:

* Doctor Wana (the Foundation’s Archaeological Institute).</br>
An unconventional archaeologist, happy to get her hands dirty searching for findings in the sector of the Lady of Tears.
* Professor Omalda darBhouno (the Mathematical Institute of Daddah).</br>
A brilliant mathematician with his heart set on explaining every mystery in the Horizon, including the Icons themselves.
* Jarros Kumbra (the Colonial Agency).</br>
One of the few within the Agency passionate about founding new colonies, however unsafe they may be.
* Drefusol Amadi (Free News).</br>
A media mogul with the ambition to reach places even the Bulletin cannot.

Group talents:

* SEASONED TRAVELERS</br>
You can test manipulation instead of culture to understand a group’s customs.
* SURVIVORS</br>
You can get out of a dangerous situation somehow connected to nature, such as a brushfire or explosive decompression. The whole group escapes the danger. The GM gets 1 DP per use. One use per session for the whole group (not once per PC).
* TRUTH SEEKERS</br>
You can find important information or get a clue from the GM without rolling dice. The information must be important enough to enable you to overcome a minor obstacle or a challenge in the scenario. The GM gets 1 DP per use. One use per session for the whole group (not once per PC).
