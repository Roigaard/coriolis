# Humanites

Not everyone in the Horizon is a normal human, or a “pureblood” as the older Hegemonists would say.
Some groups of people are biosculpted. These “humanites”, as they are called, are often found in primitive tribes on distant planets or abandoned space stations.
Common folk view the humanites as sub-human and dirty, but they are usually superbly fitted to life in the environment they were designed for.
Even the plebeians, whose work is almost the same as that of the humanites, look down upon them.

The humanites often live isolated lives, in remote colonies on hostile worlds or distant space stations, like the Sirb for example.
Some humanites live as nomads after their employers or masters have disappeared, like the Xinghur on Lubau.

Although the Foundation’s biocode census indicates that as much as 10% of the Horizon’s population carries humanite biocode, only a few humanites are publicly known.
Recognizing a humanite without advanced sensors and biometric scanners can be hard. Tiny sculpts like reptilian third eyelids, extremity hearts, or modified glands are invisible to the naked eye,
while larger modifications usually are the result of cosmetic sculpting on Coriolis, the independent station Ahalimm or in the Algolan meat district.

According to the stories of some of the more primitive peoples, there are humanites that have lost almost all their humanity and have become more like animals.
Rumors claim that the nekatra are actually the result of the Legion experimenting with lupine biocode.

Well known groups include:

* The Sirb, usually found on remote space stations or mining vessels. The Sirb have the ability to live as a group without conflicts arising and can emit scent signals that affect feelings and behaviors.
  * Biosculpt Talent: *Pheromones*
* The technically skilled Xinghur have an unknown origin, but are in several ways adapted to hot desert climates, and seem to have relatives in the Algolan deserts.
  * Biosculpt Talent: *Resistant*
* The Ichtar, who live on the Kuan north cap, are extremely cold resistant. The Nerids in the oceans of Sadaal can breathe under water and are used by the Iconocracy as workers in the heavy industry located in the planet’s oceans and marshes.
  * Biosculpt Talent: *Water Breathing*
