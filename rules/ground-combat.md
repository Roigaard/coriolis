# Ground Combat

* Turn: The span in which every participant gets to act ~ 10-20 seconds
* Ranges:
  * Close Range: up to about 2 meters (a.k.a *Engaged*)
  * Short Range: up to about 20 meters
  * Long Range: up to about 100 meters
  * Extreme Range: up to about one kilometer

## Initiative (*Turn* order)

* Roll d6 + modifiers, .e.g:
  * +2 from Surprise Attack (first turn only!)
  * Talents, e.g., Combat Veteran (roll 2d6, choose highest)
  * Some Actions (effect from the following turn)
  * Side effect of very successful Skill Checks
  * Weapons. If claimed, *must* attack with weapon or perform *no action* at all.
* Break ties randomly (no modifiers)
* May "delay" to lower initiative when it is your turn. Can keep delaying
  * The initiative on which you act becomes the new fixed initiative.
  * No interrupt - you go before or after a given combatant (Interpretation, not really stated how it works)

## Actions

You get 3 Action Points (AP) to perform actions: Slow (3AP), Normal (2AP), Fast (1AP), Free (0AP) and Reactions (varies). Use 'em or lose 'em!

Action points are refreshed at the beginning of every Turn, before anyone acts!

| aimed shot      | SLOW   | If you take your time to aim carefully before squeezing the trigger, you get a +2 to your attack roll. You cannot make an aimed shot against an enemy with whom you are engaged in close combat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| full auto       | SLOW   | Requires *Automatic Fire* feature. Your target must be within Long Range or less. You get a -2 modifier to your attack roll. Regardless of whether your initial roll is successful or not, you can choose to keep rolling dice, one at a time. These extra dice are added to your first roll. However, as soon as you roll a 1, your clip is empty and you must reload (Unless weapon has Mounted feature, in which case no further rolls can be made, but no reload is required). you can choose to distribute your dice – those in your original roll and/or the extra full auto dice – against new targets. You can do this after rolling. The first six you roll for a new target means that you inflict Weapon Damage on it. Additional sixes against the new target mean bonus effects as usual. Every new target you direct your fire against must be within Close Range of the previous target. You can fire at any number of targets, until the burst is cut off by you rolling a 1. |
| Shot            | NORMAL | Standard attack                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Reload          | NORMAL | Most firearms have large enough magazines for you not to need to worry about counting shots during a fight – just reload when the fight is over. Some Actions may empty clip, and select weapon has *Single-Shot* feature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Quick Shot      | FAST   | If there is no time for aiming, you can just shoot from the hip. You get a -2 to your attack roll. You can only fire a quick shot attack against enemies at Close Range or Short Range. If you make three quick shots in the same turn, your clip is empty or your cell depleted and you must reload your weapon. Cannot benefit from *Fire Support*.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Taking cover    | FAST   | Covers have Armor Ratings and work just like armor, but they only work against ranged attacks. Cover and armor can be combined. Simply add the dice together. Cover provides *Fire Support*. This action is separate from any movement required to reach the cover itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Enter overwatch | FAST   | assume an overwatch position, aiming in a specified direction, ready to fire your weapon in the direction of your aim any time during the coming turn (i.e. from now until your initiative score comes round again in the next turn). Your aim covers a 90-degree fire arc with your line of sight in the middle. You cannot assume an overwatch position when engaged in melee combat. As soon as you perform any action other than shooting at a target in your fire arc, your concentration breaks and your overwatch position is gone. This also immediately happens if you become engaged in close combat or you take damage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Overwatch fire  | NORMAL | [Reaction] Requires Overwatch Position. fire a normal shot (costing 2 AP) whenever you want to, before any other actions are performed – even after they have been declared. For example, if an enemy within your fire arc wants to shoot at you, you can shoot him first. Your enemy cannot change her declared action after your overwatch attack. If you and an enemy both are in overwatch position and are in each other’s fire arc, an opposed ranged combat roll (a free action for both of you) decides who goes first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

BONUS EFFECTS Purchased for additional successes beyond the first:

* Increase Damage: You inflict 1 extra point of damage. This effect can be chosen multiple times.
* Critical Injury: You inflict a critical injury on your enemy. This effect costs extra sixes (beyond the first one) equal to your weapon’s Crit Rating. By adding even more sixes, you can increase the severity of the critical injury.
* Suppressive Fire: You force your enemy to keep her head down. She suffers 1 point of stress (page 92). If you are shooting full auto fire, she takes 1 additional point of stress. This effect can be chosen multiple times.
* Raise Initiative: You assume a better position for your next attack. Your initiative score is raised by 2, taking effect at the beginning of the next turn. This effect can be chosen multiple times.
* Disarm: Your enemy drops her weapon, or some other hand-held item of your choosing. Picking something up again is a fast action.

| Defending in close combat*      | FAST   | [Reaction] Decide before attack is resolved. Defender also rolls Melee Combat. For each six you, the defender, rolled, choose an effect from the Melee Defence table.

BONUS EFFECTS Purchased for additional successes beyond the first:

* **Increase Damage**: You inflict 1 extra point of damage. This effect can be chosen multiple times.
* **Critical Injury**: You inflict a critical injury on your enemy. This effect costs extra sixes (beyond the first one) equal to your weapon’s Crit Rating. By adding even more sixes, you can increase the severity of the critical injury.
* **Strike Fear**: You strike fear into your enemy. She takes 1 point of stress (page 92). This effect can be chosen multiple times.
* **Raise** Initiative: You assume a better position for your next attack. Your initiative score is raised by 2, taking effect at the beginning of the next turn. This effect can be chosen multiple times.
* **Disarm**: Your enemy drops her weapon, or some other hand-held item of your choosing (can be picked up with Pickup action)
* **Grapple**: You pin your enemy in a tight clinch.
  * Until your enemy manages to break free, she can perform no other actions
  * To break free, your enemy must beat you in an opposed melee combat roll. The opposed roll counts as a normal action for the person in the clinch, but as a free action for you.
  * While you are grappling with a pinned opponent, grapple attacks are your only available actions
  * A grapple attack is like any other melee combat attack (a normal action), but with the following exceptions:
    * You cannot use weapons (you inflict your unarmed Weapon Damage, normally 1).
    * You get a +2 modifier to the number of dice you roll for the grapple.
    * Your enemy cannot not defend against the attack.

Melee Defence

* **Decrease Damage**: You neutralize one of the enemy’s sixes. If she is left at no sixes, the attack misses. This effect can be chosen multiple times.
* **Counterattack**: You perform a counterattack, dealing Weapon Damage to the attacker. You cannot spend additional sixes to increase the damage of your counterattack. You can, however, spend extra sixes to inflict a critical injury, but the Crit rating of your weapon is considered 1 step higher than normal. You can spend further extra sixes to increase the severity of the critical injury.
* **Disarm**: You disarm your enemy, but only after her attack has been resolved normally.
* **Raise Initiative**: Your initiative score is raised by 2, taking effect this turn if you have not yet acted. Otherwise, the effect applies at the beginning of the next turn. This effect can be chosen multiple times, for additional effect.

### Vehicle Actions

Driving under normal circumstances requires no dice rolls, but more advanced maneuvers demand pilot tests. Note that pilot is an advanced skill; unless you have a skill level of at least 1 in pilot, you don’t get to roll for it and fail the test automatically.

| Ramming with a vehicle                      | NORMAL | Dice pool = Pilot + Gear bonus. Dam = Vehicle HP/5 (round up). Damaging other vehicles request at least as many MAX HP as the target. Passengers are only damaged if the vehicle HP reaches 0, and in that case gets the full damage of the attack. |
| Getting in or out, start or drive a vehicle | FAST   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Starting or drive a vehicle                 | FAST   | Dice pool = Pilot + Gear bonus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## SNEAK ATTACKS AND AMBUSHES

* Surprise (GM decides): +2 to your initiative score (only in 1st turn, p.81)
* Sneak attack: Sneaking up on someone and attacking without them knowing is called a sneak attack.
  * First, test infiltration. Roll only once, regardless of how far you are sneaking.
  * Your roll will be modified depending on how close you want to get to your target: C(-2), S(0), L(+2), E(+4)
  * If you fail the test, you are spotted; now roll initiative scores as you would normally.
  * If you pass the infiltration test, you get a normal action “for free” before rolling initiative (*not* 2 FAST actions!)
  * If several people wish to make a joint sneak attack, they must test infiltration individually. If one fail, all fail.
* Ambush: An ambush is a special kind of sneak attack. You lie in wait for an enemy and then attack when she passes you. All participants in the ambush must test infiltration individually, as above, but each roll gets a +2 modifier because it is the target that is moving, not the attacker.

## Damage and Healing

* **Broken** 0 HP – unconscious or paralyzed with pain, and in no condition to keep fighting. You cannot perform any actions and may not test any skills. All you can do is writhe in pain and cry for help. Further normal attacks that would put you below zero HP have no effect, but you can still suffer additional critical injuries.
* **First Aid** Target must be *Broken*. medicurgy test. The medical equipment at hand determines what modifiers apply to the dice the player rolls. Without any medical equipment, the test cannot be attempted at all – you need to at least improvise something. If the roll is successful (i.e. if the player rolls at least one six), you get back up immediately, regaining HP equal to the number of sixes on the medicurgy roll.
* **Pushing on** When you have been broken and no one is around to treat you, you automatically recover 1 HP after D6 hours, and can then get back up on your own.
* **Natural healing** When you are no longer broken, you recover 1 HP per hour until you are fully healed. Critical injuries can still affect you after all your HP are restored, however.

### A note on healing

Artificial healing is not as available as in other RPG systems. What follows is my own (not RAW) analysis of what is going on.

There are 4 very different "wounded" states for a character and interpretations of what medical help represents.

* Damaged - lost some HP, but not all.
  * Being damaged is *not* dying. It is bruises and fatigue, and you still function at 100%, even at 1 HP. Recovering completely is a matter of hours, so it really isn't anything serious.
  * RAW states that you cannot benefit from first aid, i.e., artificially recover HP, and that seems reasonable, as nothing serious is wrong. You just need to get some rest.
* Broken - Lost all hp
  * Being broken is *not* dying either. You get back to fully operational "Damaged" state within D6 hours.
  * What does this state represent? RAW says "unconscious or paralyzed with pain".
  * First aid can bring you out of this state! What does that represent? Painkillers? Slapping you around? Fixing dislocated shoulder (no, that is a Crit)?
    * The action to help is called "First Aid", indicating some kind of quick fix is sufficient.
    * RAW states it required medical training *and* medical gear. What is the interpretation of that?
    * RAW states that improvised medical gear can be used - that eliminates the need for drugs or surgical equipment (though they might help), but wood and a bandage fixed to a leg, or simply dressing a wound might suffice?.
  * Consider allowing untrained Medicurgy (layperson), as this action might as well be helping someone up, psychological help or other mundane stuff. If not, it becomes difficult to explain what it actually is
    * Beware though, that this might result in a person being broken and getting back up several times during combat, if the action is not limited. Of course, that was already the case if a medic is present. Perhaps this is not an issue, as it is critical hits that will finish the job?
* Critically Wounded and recovering
  * Medicurgy can half healing time, but not skip it.
  * What does it represent?
    * For minor crits (non-fatal) it is probably good bandaging, cleaning and advice.
    * For major crits, it is probably the same, but perhaps also long term care? It is *not* the life-saving surgery itself, for that is performed separately. I could be follow-up surgery.
  * In either case, It is not unreasonable that this benefits from medical training and gear (painkillers, antibiotics, clean dressing etc.) and that layperson cannot do any real difference except comfort and ease the daily life
* Critically Wounded and dying
  * The dying ones are nasty and obviously requires trained medical personel, incl. surgery. It is very reasonable that this can only be done using Medicurgy

What really confuses my understanding, is that the same medical gear provides the same bonus to treating all the different states. How is that to be understood?
Also, "fixing" the three last states are separate Medicurgy skill checks, so they can interpreted as different treatments.

| Herbal remedy                       |  -1   |        50 | Light  | P         | A poultice preferably used together with a doctor’s bag. On its own, it gives a -1 to medicurgy to treat a broken person. Cannot be used to treat critical or fatal injuries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Medkit                              |  +2   |       700 | Normal | O         | Ordinary bag of medicurgical supplies for treating wounds, poisonings, radiation damage or severe illness. Contains a diagnostic unit, suture gun, pneumatic needles, bandages and other basic gear, as well as 10 m-doses. The medkit gives a +2 to medicurgy. Bonuses from medical equipment do not stack – use only the highest bonus.                                                                                                                                                 |
| M-dose                              |  +1   |        50 | Light  | O         | one-use injector for stabilizing wounds or treating poison, disease or radiation damage. Called “life insurance” or “first aid” in soldier slang, although the Legionnaires are of the belief that one’s carbine is the first aid, instead referring to the m-dose as the “fuse” or the “last aid”. An m-dose should be used together with a medkit; on its own it only gives a +1 to medicurgy.                                                                                          |
| Medlab                              |  +3   |     5,000 | -      | O         | A complete med unit. Gives a +3 to all medicurgy rolls to treat wounds, diseases, poison or radiation. The medlab must be resupplied after 100 treatments which costs half of the original price. If the supplies from the lab are taken away to be used in the field, they count as m-doses. A medlab takes up space equivalent to one spaceship module.                                                                                                                                 |
| Mind-enhancing narcotics            | +1/-1 |       200 | Tiny   | O*        | These drugs come in a variety of forms and with many different effects. They can be ingested, injected or applied as adhesive patches. The effects are very strong – one attribute is raised by 1 for D6 hours. The drugs come with serious fatigue after the high, however. When the PC comes down, she suffers 2 points of damage and a -1 to the affected attribute for half a day.                                                                                                    |
| P-dose                              | +2/+3 |     1,000 | Light  | F*        | The p-dose is the Order of the Pariah’s version of a regular m-dose. It is more potent but hard to come by, even in the places where it isn’t illegal. It is used like an m-dose but gives a +2 to the medicurgy roll when treating normal injuries and a +3 when treating critical injuries.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Poison                              |       | 300-3,000 | Tiny   | P         | A poison that can be applied to a weapon, eaten or injected. Common poisons have a strength of between 1 and 5, but strong ones could have a strength of up to 8. The poison attack is an opposed poison strength vs attribute roll (which attribute to test depends on which kind of poison it is). If the victim fails, she suffers damage or stress equal to the poison strength. If she wins the roll, she suffers only passing symptoms (-1 to the relevant attribute for D6 hours.) |
| Spider doctor (Wits 5, MEDICURGY 3) |       |     5,000 | Heavy  | A*        | An autonomous field medic unit with a spider-like design. Diagnoses the patient, initiates treatment and reports to other units via a level II com if needed. Applying a spider doctor to a wounded person is a slow action, but after that it acts independently with Wits 5 and medicurgy 3. The spider has a full trauma kit (no bonus).                                                                                                                                               |
| Trauma kit                          |  +3   |     2,000 | Normal | A         | An Advanced version of the medkit. Gives a +3 to all medicurgy rolls. Contains 10 trauma doses. Cannot be used without trauma doses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Trauma dose                         |  +2   |       200 | Light  | A         | An Advanced version of the m-dose. One use. Preferably used together with a trauma kit or trauma lab. Used alone it gives only a +2 to medicurgy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Trauma lab                          | +4/+5 |    20,000 | -      | A*        | A state-of-the-art med unit that gives a +4 to medicurgy rolls, or a +5 when treating critical injuries. The trauma lab must be resupplied after 100 treatments, at the cost of 15,000 birr. If the supplies from the lab are taken away to be used in the field, they count as trauma doses. A trauma lab takes up space equivalent to one spaceship module.                                                                                                                             |
