# Gear

The currency in the Third Horizon is called the birr. Your upbringing (see above) determines how many birr you start the game with, along with your starting gear. Transactions involving birr are mostly handled electronically, using so-called tags.

| Primitive (P)  | is the remains of the tech brought by the first waves of Firstcome colonists, adapted to local environments and materials.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Ordinary (O)   | is the bulk of everything produced and used by ordinary people, with exceptions for the more barbaric areas or very poor colonies. Ordinary tech is produced in modular designs to make repairs and modifications easy. It is exported and imported all across the cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Advanced (A)   | is the high end of the tech available on the open market, as long as you can afford it, have the proper connections and make the purchase in technologically advanced places such as Coriolis, the Conglomerate, the Monolith or other large trade stations and cities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Faction        | differs from Advanced technology mostly in its availability – or rather, lack thereof. available only to a select few who have pledged their allegiance to the agenda of the faction in question, or at the very least have formed a strong alliance with it. Huge amounts of birr will of course also be necessary. Faction tech is not described in detail in this book, as it will not be available to new PCs. The only way to come by it is through contacts in a faction, or theft.                                                                                   |
| PORTAL BUILDER | Relics from the Portal Builders and other old artifacts are only understood by a few people in the Horizon. Both the Foundation and the Special Branch are rumored to have cracked some of the secrets of the Portal Builders. For common people, only the light globes and the healing scarabs are available, but very expensive. The PCs will most likely not know any more about artifacts than this, unless they are professional archaeologists.                                                                                                                       |
| Restricted (*) | Restricted gear can only be purchased by PCs with the Licensed talent (see Chapter 4). Without the proper licenses, purchasing, using and producing weapons is illegal in the civilized parts of the Horizon. Without a license (or the talent Licensed, page 73), you can only obtain weapons and armor illegally through contacts in the right places or factions. Licenses purchased on Coriolis will be valid in affiliated places as well, with some local variations. Most space ports and portal stations have sensor equipment that scan for weapons and contraband |

## Encumbrance/Weight

Generally, you can carry a number of items equal to your Strength doubled. Note down one object per row on your character sheet.

* tiny (T) take up no rows at all. A good rule of thumb is, if the item can be concealed in a closed fist, it is tiny.
* Light objects (L) need only half a row on your gear list
* heavy objects (H) need two rows

Overencumbered: You can temporarily carry more than your normal load. If you do though, you must roll the Force skill each time you attempt to move any long distance. If you fail the roll you must either let go of what you are carrying, or stop where you are.

## Melee Weapons

* Power weapons have hydraulic pistons that activate on impact for increased damage.
* Dura weapons have vibrating blades made from duralite that give them better cutting capabilities.
* Duralite blades are necessary to withstand the force of the vibrations created by the weapon.
* Dura claws come mounted on a glove and some models are retractable. Extending the claws – “drawing” them – is a fast action.
* Both power and dura weapons are cell-powered, and work like their Primitive counterparts if the cells are depleted.

* Stun weapons deliver powerful electric shocks in addition to the damage from the actual blow (page 133).
* Energy weapons release a thermic blast that is much more dangerous than the hit itself. A certain amount of force is required to trigger the thermic effect, a function that has been added to limit the risk of self-harm.
* Both stun and energy weapons require cells. When a cell is depleted, the weapon works like its Primitive counterpart.

* Mercurium weapons are based on Advanced technology where liquid metals in the hilt of a weapon are activated and form a blade, after which they turn solid. Drawing and activating a mercurium weapon is one fast action.
* A cell is required to power the weapon. When the cell is depleted, the blade is extended and stays in solid form.
* A recharged cell used in a melee weapon can be force depleted by the GM at the cost of 1 DP.

## TABLE 6.10 RANGED WEAPONS

Vulcan weapons fire tiny rockets with explosive heads. Firing and reloading is mechanical and the weapons require no cells. Vulcan weapons have a low recoil to enable steady automatic fire. As they are easily pirated, they are common everywhere in the Horizon, and so is the ammunition.
Partisans, rebels, and explorers all use Vulcan weapons, often adorned with mythological or traditional images and patterns. Apart from the explosive rounds, homing and vibrating ammunition is also available, and come with cells built into special magazines.

Accelerator weapons utilize magnetic acceleration of tiny projectiles, hence the name. They are almost recoil-free, but their low rate of fire limits their military use. Thanks to their excellent precision however, they are popular with colonists,
hunters and sharpshooters. The Zenithian Hegemony favors accelerator guns over Vulcans just for the sake of precision. Some accelerator weapons have a “silent” mode, but this limits their capability to pierce armor. Accelerator weapons are hard to copy, unlike Vulcans.

Thermal weapons fire a slug of superheated matter towards their target. This process requires huge amounts of energy, which means that some thermal weapons even require fusion batteries. The adapter between the battery and the weapon
is heavy and cumbersome, and the battery itself must be carried as a backpack. The weapon still requires a magazine as hydrogen is needed for the actual shot. Heavy weapons are exceptions to this as they instead use big cassettes that are magazine and battery combined into one.

Stun weapons – popularly known as zap weapons – send powerful electrical pulses through a corridor of ionized air created by a laser beam. This is very effective over short distances when the shooter doesn’t wish to seriously injure
the target. Zap tech is available as an add-on to all thermal weapons and as separate weapons.

Blowpipes, bows and different kinds of long rifles are all examples of Primitive ranged weapons. There are no uniform principles followed by makers of long rifles, which means that all ammunition is unique to one make of rifle.

Explosives in the Horizon can be anything from Primitive detonite capsules to Advanced thermobaric grenades. Detonite is a common explosive sold in standardized units (0.25 kilograms) with modular multi-function detonators, or as satchel
charges. Larger so-called breach charges are specially constructed charges designed to destroy roads, bridges, buildinga or slow and parked vehicles. Powerful charges can cause a lot of smoke and tear up dust from the ground, especially in dry
environments. The smoke covers the same area as the blast radius of the charge for one scene. Grenades are detonite or thermanite charges with additives designed to create specific blast effects.

Regular missile systems in the Horizon are mass-produced for military groups and factions. They are usually rocket-based and have explosive warheads that function like grenades or are armor-piercing. So-called firestorm systems fire incendiary warheads.

| Feature        | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anti-vehicle   | means that the weapon is designed to take out vehicles or fortifications. The weapon does +2 damage against these targets.                                                                                                                          |
| Armor-piercing | weapons fire very fast or extra heavy projectiles that penetrate armor more effectively, but tend to cause less damage to soft targets. The Armor Rating of the target is reduced by 2, but the damage is reduced by 1 if the target has no armor. |
| Automatic fire | means that the weapon is capable of fully automatic fire (page 89).                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Bulky          | weapons cannot be used standing up without a weapon harness, or the shooter will suffer a -2 to ranged combat.                                                                                                                                      |
| Cell-powered   | melee weapons require a cell to function. Without a cell, they are treated as their Primitive counterparts.                                                                                                                                         |
| Fire           | makes objects and targets catch fire when they are hit by the weapon (see Fire in Chapter 5). The number tells you how many dice to roll for the fire each turn.                                                                                    |
| Flexible       | weapons, such as whips, can be used to pin an opponent even without rolling extra sixes (see page 86) – the first six rolled can be used to achieve a grapple hold.                                                                                 |
| Light          | weapons only count as half an item in the character inventory (page 27). They are also easier to carry concealed, requiring an observation test for someone to spot the weapon.                                                                     |
| Heavy          | weapons count as two items in the character inventory.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| High capacity  | weapons have extra-large magazines or extra cells that enable the shooter to ignore the first 1 rolled when firing fully automatic fire (page 89).                                                                                                  |
| Long           | weapons add a +2 to the weapon’s initiative bonus – but only in the first turn of combat.                                                                                                                                                           |
| Mercurium      | means that the blade of the weapon is hidden inside the hilt, requiring an observation test with a -2 modifier to spot during a search.                                                                                                             |
| Reliable       | weapons are simple and robust, and will almost never break. The weapon jam effect will cost the GM 4 DP instead of 3.                                                                                                                               |
| Slow           | weapons can only be fired every other turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Single-shot    | weapons have no magazines and must be reloaded between each shot.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Silent         | is a function that can be activated (a fast action) to make the weapon quieter and harder to detect when it is fired (requiring an observation test). A weapon in silent mode does -1 damage.                                                       |
| Stun           | means that the weapon inflicts stress instead of damage.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Thermal        | sweep means that the weapon can fire a continuous thermal beam that can be swept across several enemies. This works like automatic fire above.                                                                                                      |

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Built-in weapon       | The armor has a built-in weapon – a pistol, dagger or short sword. The weapon must be purchased separately.                                          |
| Bulky                 | -2 to dexterity rolls.                                                                                                                               |
| Camouflage unit       | When activated, the unit creates a camouflage field around the suit that makes it almost invisible and very difficult to detect (-3 to observation). |
| High-density armanite | +1 to Armor Rating.                                                                                                                                  |
| Hydrostatic gel       | +3 to Armor against explosions or falling.                                                                                                           |
| Oxygen supply         | Eight hours’ worth of oxygen, in a closed helmet.                                                                                                    |
| Magnetic boots        | The boots of the suit have electromagnets to make them work in zero-G and stick to ship hulls.                                                       |
| Micro servos          | +1 to dexterity for jumping and running.                                                                                                             |
| Reinforced exo servos | +2 to force rolls. Throwing weapons have their damage increased by 1.                                                                                |
| Thermostatic suit     | See details under Survival and Colonization on page 117.                                                                                             |
| Vacuum suit           | Protects against vacuum and radiation.                                                                                                               |
| Zero-G jet            | Tiny thrusters give increased maneuverability in zero-G (+1 to dexterity).                                                                           |
