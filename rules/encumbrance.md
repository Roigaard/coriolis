# Encumbrance

Generally, you can carry a number of items equal to your Strength doubled.

Note down one object per row on your character sheet. [Talents](talents.md) (Chapter 4) can increase your carrying capacity.

## Heavy, Light and Tiny objects

Extra heavy or cumbersome objects are harder to carry. An object deemed heavy will count double and thus take up two rows on your sheet instead of one. Some objects may even require three or more rows.

There are also objects considered light â€“ they require only half a row, meaning you can have two light items on one row.

Tiny Objects: Even smaller objects than light ones are called tiny. They are small enough not to affect your encumbrance at all. A good rule of thumb is, if the item can be concealed in a closed fist, it is tiny. 
  
## Overencumbered

You can temporarily carry more than your normal load. If you do though, you must roll the Force skill each time you attempt to move any long distance. 
If you fail the roll you must either let go of what you are carrying, or stop where you are.
