# Character Improvement

Three sources:

* Experience
* Rewards
* Reputable actions

## Gaining Experience (p.28)

How much you learn during the game is measured in Experience Points (XP).
You get your XP after each session. Have a debriefing and let everyone discuss what happened. 

For each of these questions you can answer “yes” to, you get 1 XP:

* Did you participate in the session? You get 1 XP just for attendance.
* Did you overcome a difficult challenge, to help your crew to reach its current goal?
* Did you put yourself or your crew at risk because of your personal problem?
* Did you learn something new about yourself or another PC?
* Did you sacrifice or risk something for your PC buddy?
* Did you act in accordance with your Icon?

The GM will have the last say on how many XP each PC gets, but let everyone speak their mind. Mark your XP in the checkboxes
on your character sheet. After XP have been handed out, you’re free to change relationships with the other PCs.

### Using Experience (p.28)

When you’ve gathered 5 XP, you can take an advance:

* Increasing a skill level by 1. You can never raise a skill level above 5.
* Learning a new talent. You can learn any new talent, except for Icon talents.

When you’ve taken your advance, erase 5 XP and start getting new ones.
When you’ve got another 5 XP, you can take a new advance.
You are free to save XP as long as you like, before using them.

## Rewards (p.344)

Rewards and Experience in campagins:

* Talents
* Cybernetics and bionics
* Artifacts
* Gear
* Spaceship improvements

When it comes to talents (both group and regular ones), these can also be purchased using XP.
The same goes for cybernetics and bionics, but patrons and employers could also provide the group with these, as well as with gear, modules or features.

Artifacts are something the PCs must find themselves during their adventures, however. Future products will include suggested rewards.

## Reputable Actions (p.28)

Your Reputation in the Horizon can be changed by actions you take in the game.
This is decided after the session, when XP are handed out.

* If you’ve done something generally considered good and heroic, your Reputation is increased by 1.
* If you’ve done something generally considered evil or destructive, your Reputation is decreased by 1.

Your Reputation can never go below zero. Truly remarkable deeds may change your Reputation several steps. For an action to affect your Reputation, it must be publicly recognized somehow.
