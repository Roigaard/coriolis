# Critial Injury

* Requires expenditure of #successes = Weapon Crit Rating.
* May increase *Severity* by paying additional successes. Decide how many *before* rolling. Each success = 1 additional roll. Choose which to use after all is rolled.
* Atypical damage can result in critical injuries as well, but only if the attack leaves you broken. If you drop to zero HP and there are extra sixes left unused, check the Crit Rating of the atypical damage in question. If enough sixes are left, you suffer a critical injury. A critical injury from atypical damage is usually not rolled on Table 5.6; instead, atypical damage has a special critical injury at the bottom of the table. The time limit until death varies, depending on the type of damage.
