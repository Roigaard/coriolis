# Darkness

## In the game (p.344)

Almost everybody in the Horizon believes in the Icons and the protection they offer against the Dark between the Stars.
The exact nature of the darkness is something the preachers and prophets disagree on â€“ some describe it as a dark, corrupting force, the root of all evil, while others, such as the Church of the Icons, believe that the darkness is a mirror image of the shadows and secrets of the human soul.

The only thing that is certain is that the emptiness of space seems to be the place where the human psyche is most at risk.
The endless void, emptiness and loneliness affect the minds of all spacefarers.
The darkness exists not only in space, but also in terrifying events, madness and mental trauma.
If you have gazed into the darkness, you will never be the same.
Regardless of the specific circumstances, mental strain from space travel or traumatizing events generates Darkness Points.

The GM receives DP whenever one of the below events happens:

* The PCs perform a portal jump without being in stasis: 3 DP.
* A PC suffers bad stasis after a portal jump: 1 DP.
* A PC prays to the Icons for a reroll: 1 DP.
* A PC activates a mystic power: a varying amount of DP.
* The PCs travel far out into the Big Black: 1-3 DP.
  * Well-trafficked routes. These routes run between important
planets and systems such as Kua, Algol, Dabaran, Mira, Sadaal
and Zalos. 1 DP per week of travel (for the entire PC group).
  * Lonely routes. These routes run between smaller stations within
a system or to distant systems such as Menkar and Eanu. 2 DP
per week of travel.
  * Uncharted space. Space farther than 5 ADs from a known route.
3 DP per week of travel.
* The PCs visit places or experiences events that are linked to the Dark between the Stars: a varying amount of DP.
* TERRIFYING OR SHAMEFUL EXPERIENCES
  * Witness an unnatural event: 1-3 DP
  * Suffer torture: 2 DP
  * Torture someone: 3 DP
  * Kill someone (other than enemies in a fight): 3 DP

## HOW TO USE DARKNESS POINTS

The Skills chapter describes how prayer generates DP for the GM that he can use to add more suspense to the story.
As the GM you should make sure to spend your DP, not just pool them. The DP represent that every positive force
has a negative counterforce.

The different ways you can spend your DP require a varying number of points and are described below:

* REROLL. Just like the PCs can pray to the Icons to get a reroll, the GM can reroll a skill test for an NPC. Costs 1 DP.
* TAKE THE INITIATIVE. An NPC breaks the turn order in combat and acts before her turn. The GM decides when. Costs 1-3 DP.
  * 1-2 Depending on the strength of the NPC. +1 if initiative is before any PC.
* EMPTY CLIP. A PC attacking with RANGED COMBAT runs out of ammo. The attack is not affected but the weapon needs reloading. Costs 1 DP
* WEAPON JAM. A PC's firearm jams as it fires. The attack is cancelled and a TECHNOLOGY roll (a slow action) is required to fix the weapon. Costs 3 DP.
* BROKEN SYSTEM. A system onboard stops working. It could be anything from a weapon system to life support. A TECHNOLOGY or DATA DJINN roll is required to repair it. Costs 3 DP, or 1 DP if the system in question was poorly tended to.
* SHIP PROBLEM. The ship's problem is activated. Details are specified in the list of problems. Costs 2 DP.
* OVERLOAD. A system is overloaded, either from neglected upkeep or a temporary malfunction. The system stops working for three turns (see Chapter 7). Costs 1 DP.
* REACTION. NPCs cannot perform reactions in combat (page 84) unless the GM spends 1 DP.
* LOST POSSESSION. A PC has dropped an important possession. The GM decides which. Costs 3 DP.
* REINFORCEMENTS. The enemy receives unexpected backup. The GM decides the details. Costs 1-3 DP, depending on the reinforcements.
* INNOCENT IN DANGER. An innocent bystander is suddenly caught in the line of fire and needs help. Will the PCs intervene? Costs 2 DP.
* PERSONAL PROBLEM. A PC's personal problem (page 26) affects her in a manner the GM chooses. Costs 1 DP.
* NATURE'S WRATH. Something dangerous in the environment around the PCs suddenly affects them. It could be collapsing beams or a landslide. Costs 1-3 DP depending on the level of danger, with a corresponding 1-3 difficulty increase on skill checks.
  * Sometimes, nature will affect the PCs negatively without the Darkness having anything to do with it, such as difficult terrain or storms. The nature's wrath rules below only apply when the GM spends DP to challenge the PCs.
* A DARK MIND. A PC is suddenly stricken with a temporary dark mania. More details in Chapter 14. Costs 1-3 DP.
* THE POWER OF THE DARKNESS. Certain talents or abilities can be activated in NPCs or creatures using DP. More details in Chapter 14. The DP cost varies.
* RELOADING. Normally, NPCs cannot reload their weapons, for example after automatic fire. To do it, the GM must spend 1 DP.
