# Talents

NEW TALENTS You can acquire new talents during play through Experience Points (XP). When you have collected 5 XP, you can trade them in for a new talent. You can pick any talent, with the following exceptions:

* In order to gain new cybernetic or bionic implants, you need to spend both XP and birr.
* In order to gain a new group talent, everyone in the group must spend 5 XP. You can only choose among the talents associated with your group concept.
* You can never learn new Icon talents.
  
Only once: As a rule, you can only take each talent once, but there are exceptions to this. Remember to write down all your talents on your sheet. 

## General

Below are all the general talents. They can be learned during play at a cost of 5 XP each.

| Talent                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BLESSING               | Once per session, you can bless another PC, giving her a +3 to one action. The receiver of the blessing must be within Close range of you. In combat, imparting the blessing is a slow action. The GM gets 1 DP per use.                                                                                                                                            |
| COMBAT VETERAN         | You can make your initiative roll (page 82) with two dice, and choose the best one. If you also have Accelerated Reflexes, you get to roll your initiative roll with three dice and choose the best one.                                                                                                                                                            |
| DEFENSIVE              | You are as nimble as a cat, and can easily evade close combat attacks. You get a +2 to melee combat when defending (page 87).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| EXECUTIONER            | You know where to strike to make the enemy fall and not get up again. Ever. When you inflict a critical injury, you can – if you want to – switch the dice in the D66 roll, turning the tens die into ones and vice versa. If your victim has the talent Nine Lives, the effects cancel each other out – roll normally for the critical injury.                     |
| EXO SPECIALIST         | You get a +2 to dexterity or force when handling an exo of some kind – from loaders to battle exos.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| FACTION STANDING       | You belong to a faction or a gang and can use its reputation to get a +2 to manipulation when trying to scare or threaten someone – given that the person you are threatening knows of the faction, and that the faction has some influence in the location where you are.                                                                                          |
| FIELD MEDICURG         | You know the delicate art of stopping a bleeding wound or treating grave injuries. You get a +2 to medicurgy when treating someone who is about to die from a critical injury. The talent has no effect on stress.                                                                                                                                                  |
| GEARHEAD               | You love tinkering with gear and equipment. With a successful technology test, you can repair an item or jury-rig a oneuse contraption for a specific task. The number of sixes on your roll determines the gear bonus of the item.                                                                                                                                 |
| INTIMIDATING           | You can test FORCE instead of manipulation when you are threatening someone. If you achieve a limited success, you don’t have to accept your opponent’s conditional demand – your opponent may then refuse the deal, but if she does, she must immediately attack you.                                                                                              |
| JUDGE OF CHARACTER     | You can tell if someone is lying or telling the truth without testing manipulation. It takes about a minute and you can’t tell any details, only whether the person is lying or not. Half-truths also read as lies. Each use gives the GM 1 DP.                                                                                                                     |
| LICENSED               | You have the proper licenses to buy restricted gear and weapons (Chapter 6). You can purchase the items if you can afford them, and if they are available at your location. Being licensed is not the same as being permitted to carry all kinds of weaponry in public, however. Local regulations can still stop you from carrying weapons you are allowed to own. |
| MACHINEGUNNER          | Firing full-auto is the only way to get the job done, in your opinion. Ignore the first 1 when rolling for automatic fire (page 89). Firing a weapon with the High Capacity feature, you get to ignore the first two 1s.                                                                                                                                            |
| MALICIOUS              | When you successfully manipulate someone and inflict at least 1 point of stress, she takes 1 additional point of stress.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| NINE LIVES | No matter how bad it looks, you always seem to come out of situations alive. When you suffer a critical injury, you get to switch the dice – turning the tens digit into the ones and vice versa (page 94). If your attacker has the talent Executioner, the effects neutralize each other – roll the critical injury normally.                               |
| POINT BLANK            | When you shoot someone and hit, you automatically add an extra six to your roll – but only if you attack from Close Range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| RAPID RELOAD           | You can reload a weapon as a fast action, rather than as a normal one (page 83).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| RUGGED                 | You are used to extreme weather and other natural hazards (cold, storms, strong gravity, fire, etc.). The talent counts as “armor” with an Armor Rating of 3 against natural damage.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| SEDUCTIVE              | You have an eye for romance, and get a +2 to manipulation in situations when you try to achieve something through seduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| SPRINTER               | Your Movement Rate (page 84) is increased from 10 to 12 meters. You can learn this talent up to three times, for a maximum Movement Rate of 16 meters. This talent can be combined with the Quick talent, but not with Cybernetic Muscles.                                                                                                                          |
| SOOTHING               | You read others as if they were open books, and possess a natural quality that makes people open up to you. You get a +2 to medicurgy when treating someone who has been broken by stress (page 92).                                                                                                                                                                |
| TALISMAN MAKER         | You know how to create and bless talismans. The process takes D6 hours and requires a chapel or an altar. A talisman provides a +1 to one skill test, then the blessing wears off.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| THE HASSASSIN’S THRUST | You are a highly trained assassin. When you make a sneak attack (page 85) using a small weapon, you get +2 to melee combat.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| THIRD EYE              | You have the ability to sense an ambush, and once per session you can avoid the effects of being surprised. The talent also gives you a constant +2 to observation when trying to detect a sneak attack or an ambush.                                                                                                                                               |
| TOUGH                  | You are used to taking a beating. You get 2 additional Hit Points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| WEALTHY FAMILY         | You can use the rumors of your family’s vast riches to give yourself a +2 to manipulation in any situation where the GM deems it relevant. Whether the rumors are true or not doesn’t matter. You can only choose this talent if you come from a Privileged background (page 21).                                                                                   |
| ZERO-G TRAINING        | Your sense of balance is well adapted to an environment without gravity. You get a +2 to dexterity when in zero-G.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Humanite

| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PHEROMONES      | You have the ability to transmit and receive pheromones via enlarged dermal glands on your chest, neck or face. Your pheromones spread through air and will not work in a vacuum or affect people in exos. The pheromones make others obey you – you get a +2 to manipulation. One use per session. |
| RESISTANT       | Your body can endure extreme weather and other natural hazards. The talent counts as “armor” with an Armor Rating of 6 against natural damage. You can combine Resistant with Rugged, for a total Armor Rating of 9 against natural damage.                                                         |
| WATER BREATHING | You can breathe normally under water.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## Cybernetic

Cybernetic implants will cost you both birr and XP. They also demand D6 days of healing after the procedure before they can be used.

| ACCELERATED REFLEXES | 7000  | Your nerves are cybernetically modified with extra wiring and micro djinn, giving you superb body control. You get a +2 to dexterity for acrobatic maneuvers, and you get to roll your initiative with two dice and pick the best one to determine your initiative score.

The implants give you a -1 to dexterity for acrobatic maneuvers.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| BUILT-IN WEAPON      | 3000  | You have a built-in weapon. The weapon is hard to detect and can only be discovered by someone actively searching for it. The weapon itself must be bought separately. To “draw” a built-in weapon is a free action.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| COM LINK             | 1500  | You have a built-in communications device, similar to a personal communicator. The benefit of the link is that it is very hard to detect – you can verbalize your message in your mind, and the receiver is jacked directly into your auditory system.                                                                                                                                              |
| CYBERNETIC MUSCLES   | 7000  | Muscles enhanced with ceramic fibers make you an extremely fast and strong runner. Your Movement Rate is increased by 4 meters per fast action (cannot be combined with Sprinter or Quick). The damage of your unarmed attacks is increased to 2.                                                                                                                                                   |
| ENDO SKELETON        | 7000  | An endo skeleton with powerful hydraulics and strong alloys supports your body, making you considerably stronger than others – you get a +2 to force for heavy lifting. Your carrying capacity is doubled. You get 2 extra Hit Points.                                                                                                                                                              |
| LANGUAGE MODULATOR   | 12000 | Your larynx and vocal chords have been replaced with a sound modulator and an interpreter unit. You can automatically translate your speech to another language if you speak slowly. The modulator supports up to five different language packs. See Language Unit in Chapter 6.                                                                                                                    |
| LIE DETECTOR         | 4000  | You have a built-in lie detector. To use it on someone, you must touch the person, speak to her, and look her in the eyes. Test manipulation with a +2 (not an opposed roll). If you pass, you can tell if the person is lying or not.                                                                                                                                                              |
| PASSIVE SENSORS      | 2000  | Passive sensors are implanted in your body. You can use them like the passive mode on a personal sensor whenever you wish. Details for personal sensors are found in Chapter 6.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| SERVO LOCKS          | 4000  | The joints in your arms and shoulders have been replaced with lockable servo units, enabling you to carry extremely heavy objects for short distances, and grapple people in combat very effectively. You get a +2 to melee combat when your opponent tries to break free from your grappling hold, and a +2 to force for heavy lifting.                                                            |
| SKIN ELECTRODES      | 6000  | Your palms are fitted with conductive surfaces capable of transmitting powerful electrical shocks. After a successful unarmed attack, you can choose to inflict 2 points of stress (page 92) instead of dealing damage. Each additional six rolled inflicts 1 extra point of stress.                                                                                                                |
| TARGETING SCOPE      | 20000 | One of your eyes has been enhanced with a targeting  scope. Makes it easier to hit with firearms (+1 to ranged combat) at Short range and above. Does not work for quick shots (page 88).                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| VOICE AMPLIFIER      | 2000  | A resonance chamber with built-in loudspeakers in your throat can amplify your voice. You get a +2 to command or manipulation in situations where a loud voice is a benefit, for example when intimidating someone.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| WATER BREATHING      | 5000  | Artificial gills allow you to extract oxygen from water. You can remain under water for as long as you like.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| WEATHERPROOF         | 2000  | You are heavily modified to withstand all climates, recycle body fluids and conserve energy. The effect of this is that the time between each point of damage you suffer from thirst or hunger (page 98) is doubled – to 24 hours and 4 days, respectively.                                                                                                                                         |

## Bionic

Like cybernetics, bionic improvements of your body will cost you both 5 XP and birr. They also require D6 days of healing after the procedure, before they can be used.

| Talent          | Cost    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BEAUTIFUL       | 25K     | Your beauty is breathtaking. Whether by classical standards or tasteful originality, you turn heads wherever you go. Your biosculpted looks give you a +2 to manipulation whenever they can affect the situation. People with the appropriate sexual orientation tend to fall in love with you. If you are in a place with different ideals of beauty, the GM may decide to ignore your modifier. |
| BUILT-IN WEAPON | 40K     | You have a built-in weapon that counts as a primitive melee weapon (for example claws, a shorter blade or throwing knives). The weapon is very discreet and only a thorough medical check-up can discover it. “Drawing” a built-in weapon is a free action.                                                                                                                                       |
| INTELLIGENT     | 25K     | Your brain’s bio code and cognitive pathways have been altered to make you cold and logical. You get a +1 to all science and technology tests, but a -2 to manipulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| MORPH           | 30K-60K | Your body is sculpted so that your entire physiognomy is changed – you could have anything from wings to extra limbs. This gives you obvious benefits, but could trigger fear and disgust among common people, or even hate among fanatics. Your Reputation is lowered by 2. See list of known morphs.                                                  |
| NIMBLE          | 15K     | Your bionically enhanced nerves give you amazing agility. You get a +2 to dexterity for acrobatic feats and gymnastic maneuvers. The modifier also applies to dance and other physical activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| QUICK           | 10K     | Your muscles are bionically altered for incredibly explosive speed, making you a fast runner. Your Movement Rate is increased by 4 meters (can be combined with Sprinter but not with Cybernetic Muscles). You can jump 5 meters horizontally from standing still, 15 meters with a running start (slow action), and 2 meters vertically.                                                         |
| REGENERATE      | 15K     | You heal fast, and recover remarkably quickly even from grave injuries. The time to heal a critical injury (page 94) is halved. You also get 2 extra Hit Points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Known MORHPS

* EXTRA PAIR OF ARMS: You can perform an extra fast action per turn, as long as you can use the extra arms for that action.
* EXTRA FINGERS: You can use tools, make repairs, operate computers or do other tasks that require fine motor skills with extraordinary ease. You get a +1 in situations where fine motor skills are paramount, such as advanced MEDICURGY, repairing precision engineering with TECHNOLOGY, or reprogramming a computer using DATA DJINN. Unfortunately, your brittle and sensitive fingers give you a -2 to FORCE.
* WINGS: You can glide up to Long Range if you leap from at least 20 meters up. Test DEXTERITY to land without taking damage (failure means D6 points of damage). When on the ground, you suffer a -1 to DEXTERITY, due to the size of the wings.
* PREHENSILE TAIL: You get a +2 to DEXTERITY when climbing or moving around in low- or zero-G. The tail is easily hidden under a coat or a caftan.

## Mystical

In order to learn a mystical power, you need at least skill level 1 in the skill mystic powers. To activate a power, you must pass a MYSTIC POWERS test. In combat, this is normally a slow action. A failed roll means that the power does not activate properly – giving you incorrect information or resulting in some other undesired effect. The GM decides the details. Each use of a power gives the GM 1 DP.

| Talent      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ARTIFICER   | You can enter a trance to understand an artifact close to you, and to determine its origin and use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| CLAIRVOYANT | You get visions of where an object or a person can be found. The GM decides what form the visions take, but as a rule of thumb, an object you once owned is easier to locate than an object only described to you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| EXORCIST    | You can enter a trance and exorcise an intruding spirit from someone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| INTUITION   | You get to ask the GM a simple yes/no question about anything in the game world. He must answer truthfully “yes”, “no” or “maybe”. The GM can answer “maybe” even if he knows the answer, if he thinks answering yes or no would upset the game too much. Please note that neither truths nor lies are universal – it depends on who is asking. Opinions, morals and worldviews can make something true to someone and false to someone else. |
| MIND READER | You can read someone else’s thoughts for a minute or so. You can only read surface thoughts; you can’t dig for any deeper memories. Your target must be within Close Range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| MIND WALKER | If you focus your thoughts on a person you have previously met, you can tap into that person’s sensory input. You experience what that person sees, hears and feels in that exact moment, regardless of where in the Horizon she is. No thoughts or emotions are transmitted.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| PREDICTION  | If you conduct a séance, you can experience powerful visions of the future. You ask the GM questions about yourself or someone else taking part in the séance. The GM answers as best he can. The answers should be short, preferably mysterious and ambiguous. An answer could also take the form of an omen, a sign of fortune or tragedy waiting around the corner.                                                                        |
| PREMONITION | In some mysterious way, you can sense impending danger. The GM will have you test MYSTIC POWERS – if you pass, you get a feeling of a looming threat, but no details about what it might be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| STOP        | You can stop an NPC from performing an action she otherwise would have. It must be something subtle, that can be attributed to simple forgetfulness. Typical examples would be that the NPC lets the PCs pass a roadblock without checking their papers, or forgets her keys somewhere. The power cannot be used to stop an incoming attack.                                                                                                  |
| TELEKINESIS | You can lift, move, turn or bend an object using sheer force of will. The item must be tiny – larger objects are beyond your control. No dice roll is needed, unless you want to use the object for something demanding like moving a key to a lock and then turning it. Then test any appropriate skill. The power cannot be used in combat.                                                                                                 |
