# Fugitive

*You can never stop moving. Always look over your shoulder.
Always sleep with a gun under your pillow.
You are on the run from the past.
It doesn’t matter what you once may or may not have done – all that matters is getting to the next hideout, the next safe haven.
But some day you shall be rid of your pursuers.
Some day you will dare sleep with your back to the door.*

## Sub-concepts

### CRIMINAL

You make sure that the birr keeps
flowing in the back alleys of society, no matter
if it takes threats or even outright violence to
do it. You could be a gang member, a corsair or
an opor dealer, maybe even one of the despised
Algolan slavers.

* Concept Skills: Force, Melee Combat, Dexterity, Infiltration

### MYSTIC

You are on the run, stigmatized and
possibly being tracked. Your past life is gone.
Now, you are a prisoner to nightmares and the
crippling anxiety over what trouble your powers
will cause next.

* Concept Skills: Manipulation, Mystic Powers, Dexterity, Infiltration

### REVOLUTIONARY

You want to make the Horizon
a better place. To do it, the oppressors must be
destroyed. You could be a member of the Kuan
Free Brigades, a rebel on Uharu, or maybe one of
the Maskless, fighting the regime on Sadaal.

* Concept Skills: Ranged Combat, Dexterity, Observation, Survival
