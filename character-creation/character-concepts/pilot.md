*Your ship and you are as one. At the helm,
you feel complete freedom and a righteous
Iconic presence. You are never more alive

or when you defy death by diving into an
asteroid field. Flying is living, and you want
to live more than ever.*

## Sub-concepts

### DRIVER

You thrive in your vehicle, free to roam as
you please across the planet’s surface. You could
be a hoverbike racer in the Conglomerate slums, a
caravan driver, or an attack hovercraft pilot.

* Concept Skills: Force, Pilot, Ranged Combat, Survival

### FIGHTER PILOT

You can afford to be cocky and
obnoxious, because you know that in the cockpit
of your fighter, you are a god. Perhaps your ship is
a torpedo boat or a breach pod, maybe you are a
corsair hunter or a dogfight ace.

* Concept Skills: Data Djinn, Pilot, Ranged Combat, Technology

### FREIGHTER PILOT

You travel the Horizon’s trade
routes in a freighter. The Dark between the Stars
doesn’t scare you. You could be a free trader, a
dust trawler, a bulk hauler pilot or an ice miner.

* Concept Skills: Data Djinn, Force, Pilot, Technology

## PERSONAL PROBLEM

* You are reckless and take stupid risks with yourself and your ship, even when it isn’t necessary.
* You hate humanites/the Privileged/nekatra/the Zenithian Hegemony/something else, and will do anything to provoke one of them if they get close.
* You scare easily and never challenge yourself. Better safe than sorry.

## RELATIONSHIPS TO THE OTHER PCS

* … thinks that you are a rickshaw driver. This annoys you.
* … can take a Zero-G roll without throwing up. Impressive.
* … is a good friend, someone to trust.
