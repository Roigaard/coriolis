power that lies in closing a deal when all
hope seems lost. Your sharp intellect and
silver tongue can move mountains.*

## Sub-concepts

### AGITATOR

You make sure the people or the customers
know what’s important, whether your
goal is to stir a revolt or sell a product. Perhaps
you are a rebel prophet, a statistician at the
Sadaal Institute of Planning, or an ad djinn at a
Consortium firm.

* Concept Skills: 

### DIPLOMAT

You parley and negotiate between the
factions and dynasties of the Horizon. A peace
treaty or free trade agreement is usually the goal.
You could be a consul, a trade mission official, or
the personal ambassador of a wealthy family. Less
glamorous jobs like customs officer or bureaucrat
are also possible.

* Concept Skills:

### PEDDLER

You scheme and deal in anything from
frozen goats to Kuan hardwood. Profit is your
imperative, and birr jingling in your pockets make
you truly happy. You could be a free trader, an
import mogul, or the dabra of a souk. Or you could
be working from the shadows as a smuggler or a
fence for the Syndicate.

* Concept Skills:

## PERSONAL PROBLEM

* You have a protégé that you need to take care of. It could be a relative or a friend you owe a debt of gratitude.
