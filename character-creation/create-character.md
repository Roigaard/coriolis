# Character Creation

First, [determine the group concept](./group-concepts/creating-group.md).

Then, each player creates a character for that group using the following steps:

1. Choose [Background](#background)
   1. Attribute points and skill points (for later placement)
   2. Reputation
   3. Money
2. Choose [Character concept](#character-concept)
   1. Defines *concept* attribute and skills (only relevant for initial placement of points)
   2. Choose *concept* talent
   3. Modify reputation (if needed)
   4. Select starting gear (free, does not cost money)
   5. Choose relationships to other PC.
   6. Choose personal problem. The problem is a source of extra XP.
   7. Choose one other PC to be your *Buddy*. The buddy is a source of extra XP.
3. Distribute [attribute](../SkillsAndAttributes.md) points
   1. Normal human range is 1-5
   2. Must assign 2-4 points to each (5 for Concept attribute)
4. Calcuate Hit Points (HP) and Mind Points (MP)
   1. HP = Strength + Agility
   2. MP = Wits + Empathy
5. Distribute [Skill](../SkillsAndAttributes.md) points
   1. Normal human range is 0-5
   2. Must assign at most 1 point to each skill (3 to concept skills)
6. Determine the [Icon](../Icons.md) under which you are born.
   1. Note *icon* talent on character sheet.
   2. The icon is a source of extra XP.
7. Choose crew position.

Lastly, choose a name.

## Background

The first thing you must do is to decide on your PC’s background.
Where are you from? How did you grow up? Are you a normal human or a humanite? The answers will be the foundation on which to build your PC.

* Are you Zenithian or Firstcome, and what is your planet of origin (purely narrative elements)
* Are you Human or [Humanite](../people/humanites.md)
* Upbringing
  * **Plebeian** The lower class of the Horizon, workers as well as planetside colonists and nomads.
  * **Stationary** Raised on major space stations or asteroids
  * **Privileged** Highest of the social strata – bureaucrats and factory owners in the Conglomerate, Dabaran pashas, and wealthy merchants on Coriolis, pure-blooded Hegemonists in the Monolith

The following table shows the game mechanical effects of upbringing.
Humanites can only be pleabian or stationary, receive half reputation from upbringing and gain a biosculpting talent (see linked description of humanites)

| UPBRINGING       | PLEBEIAN | STATIONARY | PRIVILEGED |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| ATTRIBUTE POINTS | 15       | 14         | 13         |
| SKILL POINTS     | 8        | 10         | 12         |
| REPUTATION       | 2        | 4          | 6          |
| STARTING CAPITAL | 500 birr | 1,000 birr | 5,000 birr |

## Character concept

The concept tells you what you do for a living.
Each concept contains several sub-concepts to give your PC more detail.
Your concept affects your attributes, which skills and talents you can choose from at the start of the game, your gear, your relationships and your personal problem.

Concepts and subsconcepts:

* [ARTIST](./character-concepts/artist.md) – Courtesan, Musician, Poet
* [DATA SPIDER](./character-concepts/data-spider.md) – Analyst, Correspondent, Data Djinn
