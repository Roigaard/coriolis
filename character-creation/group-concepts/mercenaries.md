# MERCENARIES

Not all can enjoy the peace and prosperity of the new era.
Old wounds fester in the dark, and the absence of peace means plenty of job opportunities for people like you: Mercenaries.
As such, you are often both feared and scorned, yet valuable pawns in the power plays of the factions.
Mercenaries can be anything from Legionnaires to hired guns for the Consortium.
Typical jobs for you would be crushing rebels on Uharu-9, hunting corsairs in the Border Space, or toppling Dabaran pashas.

The Mercenaries group concept can also be used for:

* Corsairs plundering careless free traders on lonely routes.
* Rebels fighting to free their people from oppression.
* Tactical teams performing whatever military operations the factions might require.

Possible concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Mercenaries:

* Operative (spy). You are the group’s expert on alarm systems and infiltration, and your network of contacts is vast. With your help, the jobs run smoother and require less Vulcan hails than they otherwise would.
* Pilot (fighter pilot). Someone has to fly the iron fist you call your ship, land your drop pod or armored hovercraft.
* Scientist (technician). Tending to your death machines is a rigorous job. Without someone to look after the crew’s equipment, you’d soon be worth about as much as skavara droppings in a dung plant.* Soldier (officer). Without you, the group would be without discipline. In a crisis, you are quick to take charge.
* Soldier (legionnaire). The backbone of any mercenary group. You could be anything from a field medicurg, to a weapons expert or a marine. Regardless, you and your trusty carbine get the job done.
* Trailblazer (scout). You make sure your surroundings are clear, be it in the hills of the Xifas ridge or the scrap belt around Qugassa. You could be a sniper, a scout, an ex-burglar or a sensor specialist.

Patron/Nemesis ideas:

* Hatma “The Skull” Kerash (the Legion).</br>
A recruiter for the Legion but also involved in running operations that are too dirty for Legion standards.
* Captain Arina Chike (the Chike Company).</br>
An exiled Hegemonist who raids faction ships in Kua’s outer rim from a secret base. 
* High General Abassar Douk (the Free Uharan Army).</br>
A leader of rebel forces all across the Menkar arm, an idealist and a pragmatist in one.
* Farhad Krisma (Strike Team Krisma).</br>
An ex-judicator, now hired by the Consortium for interventions against rebels and agents of other factions.

Group talents:

* ASSAULT</br>
You get a +2 to ranged combat, but only when everyone in the group attacks the same target in the same turn. 
* CHARGE</br>
You get a +2 to melee combat, but only when everyone in the group, in the same turn, also spends at least one fast action (1 AP) on movement. The bonus lasts one turn only.
* SITUATIONAL AWARENESS</br>
You always know your surroundings, and get a +2 to observation when testing it to discover an ambush.
