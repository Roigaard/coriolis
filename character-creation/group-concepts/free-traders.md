# Free Traders

Commerce is what greases the wheels of the Third Horizon, and the hub of trade in the region is the space station Coriolis.
The free traders are the entrepreneurs and innovators of the Horizon, embracers of the new order – with a few exceptions.
Tariffs, tolls, and bureaucrats looking to make a quick buck abusing the trade system are all things despised by any free trader.
As Free Traders, you will portal jump between the different systems of the Third Horizon, hauling everything from goats on ice or farm machinery to candied Kabra bugs and illegal Vulcan carbines.
In small freighters or enormous bulk haulers, you travel silent routes in an ocean of cold starlight.
Slipping past corrupt toll collectors, blockade ships and corsairs are all part of your thrilling lives.

The Free Traders group concept can also be used for:

* Smugglers carrying illegal cargo to the highest bidder.
* Bulk haulers on lonely routes with heavy loads.
* Couriers delivering valuable information.

Possible character concepts (with sub-concepts) for PCs as a group of Free Traders:

* Negotiator (peddler). If it wasn’t for you, the crew would still be delivering livestock to the asteroid belt. You make sure those sweet birr end up in your bank account.
* Pilot (freighter pilot). Someone needs to fly this thing.
* Scientist (technician). A ship is only as good as its mechanic or technician. You make sure the group gets anywhere at all.
* Ship worker (deckhand). There is always something that needs doing onboard. The others may think that you mainly scrub air filters, but there is no one who knows the ship like you do.
* Ship worker (dock worker). You oversee the cargo – a crap job some would say, but this is far from true. Without you, the crew wouldn’t earn a single birr.
* Soldier (legionnaire). Corsairs, mercenaries, smugglers. The list of cold-blooded fighters out there in the Dark is long. You and your Vulcan carbine protect the group when the going gets rough.

Patron/Nemesis ideas:

* Aldair Jubal (Jubal Imports & Exports).</br>
A shady peddler from Djachroum, making sure the flow of spices, drugs and weapons continues.
* Abdul Nasr (the Free League).</br>
A merchant specializing in technological artifacts, operating out of Ozone Plaza on Coriolis.
* Lea Marhoun (Zenithian Trade Alliance).</br>
An antiques dealer from the Monolith, specializing in trade in artifacts and archaeological findings.
* Mukhtar Sawalla (Hyperion Logistics).</br>
An agent of a Consortiumowned corporation, running bulk haulers all over the Horizon.

Group talents:

* A NOSE FOR BIRR</br>
When trading, you get a +2 to manipulation. One use per session for the whole group (not once per PC).
* EVERYTHING IS FOR SALE</br>
You have a knack for finding the most corrupt public servants, toll officers or guards, and always get a +2 to manipulation when you are bribing someone.
* QUICKEST ROUTE</br>
You find the quickest route. Travel takes half the time (page 138), or one encounter along the way may be ignored. The GM gets 1 DP per use. One use per journey.
