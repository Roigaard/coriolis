There are four things that can result in modifiers:

* Your gear usually between +1 and +3.
* The difficulty of your action
* Prayer and preparatory prayer (page 55)
* Assistance from others = +1/helper, max 3.
  Helping slow action is a slow action
  Helping normal or fast action is normal action
* Command (Normal action regardless of command) = +1/success. Must execute the Commanded action to get bonus!

You and the other PCs cannot help each other when you are
acting simultaneously, that is when you are performing the
same action at the same time – for example when you are trying
to sneak past a guard (infiltration), or when you walk into
an ambush (observation). Then you must all roll separately.
If the outcome of your roll is really good, some skills allow
you to share your success with a friend, who in turn does
not have to roll. You can help someone this way even if that
person has already failed her roll.

DIFFICULTY MODIFIER

* Child’s Play +3
* Effortless +2
* Easy +1
* Normal 0
* Demanding -1
* Hard -2
* Insane -3

If your modifiers put you at zero dice or fewer, roll two
dice – but to succeed, both have to show sixes. Hard, but not
impossible!

OPPOSED ROLLS

Sometimes, a six will not be enough to pass a skill test. In
these cases, you also have to beat an enemy’s roll. This is
called an opposed roll. To win an opposed roll, you have to
roll more sixes than your opponent. Each of your opponent’s
sixes cancels out one of yours. Only you (the attacker) can
pray to the Icons on an opposed roll. Sometimes, you and
your opponent will test different skills, sometimes the same.
Opposed rolls are always used when you roll for manipulation
or infiltration, and when someone uses these skills
against you. The GM can also call for an opposed roll when
he deems it appropriate, for example force vs force to
resolve some armwrestling.
Combat: In combat (Chapter 5), an opposed roll only counts
as an action for you (the attacker), not for your opponent
(the defender).
