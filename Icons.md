# Icons

| Icon              | Symbol           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| THE LADY OF TEARS | A TEAR           | On their way towards the justice of the Judge, the dead are accompanied by the Lady of Tears. She also consoles the living. The Lady of Tears is a woman dressed in white, the color of mourning, with traces of tears still on her cheeks.                             |
| THE DANCER        | A SWEEPING SHAWL | The Dancer is the Icon of inspiration and perseverance. Sometimes a woman, sometimes a man, mostly androgynous. The Dancer represents the bond formed in the union between two lovers, but also unbridled lust when appearing as the Musician, playing a lyre or cirra. |
| THE GAMBLER       | DICE             | For the adventurous, the Gambler is a perfect fit. This Icon is often pictured as a little girl stretching her hand towards the beholder, her eyes urging you to take a risk, to roll the dice.                                                                         |
| THE MERCHANT      | A CHALICE        | The portly Merchant, an older man dressed in embroidered silk robes, is the Icon of growth, prosperity and success.                                                                                                                                                     |
| THE DECKHAND      | A KEY            | This Icon is usually portrayed as a tired boy holding a broom. The Deckhand can bless homes and ships, if they’re well-kept and the right offerings have been made.                                                                                                     |
| THE TRAVELER      | A SHIP           | For free traders, explorers and colonists, the Traveler offers protection. The Traveler is often portrayed as a man with his eyes on the horizon, holding a walking stick, a compass or an astrograph.                                                                  |
| THE MESSENGER     | A SCROLL         | The fleet-footed Messenger brings news, prayers and omens to wherever the faithful might be. The Messenger is portrayed as a pale boy with a stern face and flaming eyes.                                                                                               |
| THE JUDGE         | A SWORD          | An old matriarch with a grave face and a sword at her side is the common way to picture the Judge. The Judge’s realm is that of justice and due punishment.                                                                                                             |
| THE FACELESS      | NO SYMBOL        | The seeker among the Icons is never pictured. In temples and on Icon walls there is instead an empty place or alcove, or an asymmetry in the placement of the other Icons.                                                                                              |

## Icon Talents

As your PC is born under the sign of one of the Icons, she is blessed by it. Icons (and thereby the talents) are determined randomly when creating your PC and can never be learned during play. Icon talents can be used once per session, and each use gives the GM 1 DP.

| Icon              | Talent |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| THE LADY OF TEARS | You can get back up after having been broken by damage or stress, and are immediately restored to 1 HP or MP (read more in Chapter 5). Alternatively, you can choose to ignore the effects of a critical injury when you suffer one. |
| THE DANCER        | You can evade an incoming attack, taking no damage. You can choose to activate the talent after a successful attack roll, but before you roll any cover or armor dice. |
| THE GAMBLER       | You are incredibly lucky and can choose an automatic critical success on a skill test of your choice. It counts as if you had rolled three sixes. If it is an advanced skill, you still need a level of at least 1 in that skill to activate the talent. |
| THE MERCHANT      | You can find a favorable loan enabling you to purchase an expensive object or a ship module. The loan must then be paid back within the agreed upon timeframe.|
| THE DECKHAND      | If your ship drops to zero Hull Points or Energy Points, you can restore D6 points of either kind instantly. This requires no action from you – it is the Icons intervening on your behalf.|
| THE TRAVELER      | You can ask the GM about a choice you have to make in the game. It has to be a choice with only two options. The GM must then answer truthfully which of the two is most beneficial to you, if that is at all possible to estimate.|
| THE MESSENGER     | You can make someone obey you, through careful words and actions, without having to test manipulation. Can be used on both NPCs and PCs. Your wish must be reasonable, you cannot, for example, force an NPC to act completely against her own interests.|
| THE JUDGE         | You deal an automatic critical injury when your attack hits, regardless of whether the attack penetrated cover and armor. Any other effects from the attack are resolved as usual.    |
| THE FACELESS      | Fate is on your side, giving you the benefit of getting to change a single, concrete detail in a scene more to your favor. It must be something that has a cosmetic or indirectly helpful effect – you cannot make an enemy disappear, but you can decide that there is a knife within reach, or that a window has been left open. The GM has final say on what is possible to accomplish with the talent. |
